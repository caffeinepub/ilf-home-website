  "summary": "The diff shows implementation of a complete ILF Home website with frontend pages, routing, and a basic Motoko backend. All backend and frontend compilation issues appear to be addressed through proper imports, type definitions, and component structure. However, the BuildRequest focuses specifically on fixing deployment errors, and the diff does not include evidence of actual deployment configuration, build scripts, or canister configuration files that would be necessary to verify REQ-9's acceptance criteria (successful IC deployment and canister operation).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Diagnose and resolve all deployment errors preventing the application from successfully building and deploying to the Internet Computer network",
      "reason": "While backend and frontend code are present, there is no evidence of deployment configuration files (dfx.json, package.json build scripts, webpack config, etc.) that would be required to actually deploy to IC. The diff shows code implementation but not deployment infrastructure or fixes to deployment errors.",

      "description": "Complete multi-page website with HomePage, CommunityPage, HousingPage, SupportPage, and VolunteerPage",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly states 'Non-goals: Adding new features or functionality; Changing the visual design or styling'. The diff shows creation of a full website with multiple feature-rich pages including contact forms, navigation, hero sections, and extensive content - these are new features not requested in the deployment error fix scope.",
